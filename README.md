## About
The BEAP platform, initally developed by [Stretta](http://www.stretta.com), allows users to use custom modules to create modular patches very easily. While we really enjoyed using the built-in BEAP modules available in Max 7, we felt that we could take some time off to develop some more custom modules to add to the platform.  
These modules are available for free however we do not offer support for them.  
Enjoy!

## Available Modules
* **Quad Spatial Mixer** : The QSM is a 4-ch mono mixer which features Pan CV inputs for all channels and 1 stereo aux channel.
* **Digital Noise** : Digital noise generator with Rate control and CV input.
* **Karma** : Sampler module that uses the [Karma~](https://github.com/rconstanzo/karma) object created by Rodrigo Constanzo & raja.
*  **Matrix Router**: Pin matrix router inspired by the EMS VSC3 synthesizer.
